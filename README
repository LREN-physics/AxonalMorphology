In-vivo estimation of axonal morphology from MRI and EEG data
Rita Oliveira, Andria Pelentritou, Giulia Di Domenicantonio, Marzia De Lucia, Antoine Lutti

The main objective is to use data collected in-vivo in humans to estimate 
microscopic morphologic features of the white matter tracts.

The in-vivo data estimated along a white matter tract of interest includes:
    •  the MRI g-ratio sampled along the visual transcallosal white matter tract
    •  a measure of conduction velocity estimated from an EEG measure of 
interhemispheric transfer time (IHTT)

The microscopic morphologic features of white matter we estimate are:
    •  the axonal radius distribution, P(r)
    •  the g-ratio dependence on the radius, g(r)

INPUT DATA:

The initial data necessary to be able to run this analysis includes:
    •  The raw data EEG (in the format block_X.TRC; and metrics obtained 
    during the visual paradigm implemented, in the folder EEG/Matlab_Outputs)
    •  The digitization file containing the position of the electrodes on 
    the EEG cap (SubjectName.elec)
    •  MRI g-ratio sampled along the visual transcallosal tract in matrix 
    format (G_ratio_samples.mat)
    •  The length of the visual transcallosal tract in matrix format 
    (Tract_length.mat)
    •  Freesurfer output files (segmented structural image as obtained from
    Freesurfer: lh.BA_exvivo.annot, rh.BA_exvivo.annot, BA_exvivo.ctab,
    T1.mgz, rh.pial, lh.pial)

DATA FOLDER ORGANIZATION:

The folder structure looks like this:

> Subjects
>> SubjectName
>>> EEG
>>>> Originals  
>>>> Matlab_Outputs
>>>> Preprocessed      
>>>> Delays 
>>>> Statistics_Source
>>> MRI
>>>> MicrostructureEstimation
>>>> Freesurfer
>> Study_Group_Results

The majority of the folders are created along the scripts, with exception
of the folders containing the data mentioned in the previous section.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION OF THE MAIN ANALYSIS STEPS:

    •  SET PATHS 
		Creates the path structure used in all the other scripts. 
		User needs to edit this script and change the path variables 
		to match the ones on the user's local computer.
		
	•  SET PARAMETERS
		Creates the parameters needed to run the analysis. 
		It defines the subjects to run, the conditions used on the 
		EEG paradigm, the structure with the parameters for EEG
		preprocessing and the structure with the parameters for EEG
		statistical cluster permutation analysis.
		User needs to edit this script and change the parameters 
		to the desired ones.
		
		> To replicate the results of the associated scientific article,
		given that the IHTT concerned only the 'Left' visual stimulation, 
		cond_list is {'Left'} (set by default).

		
	•  EEG - PREPROCESSING 
		Preprocessing of EEG data with Fieldtrip and EEGlab software. This script 
		assumes that the data was acquired under different blocks/runs 
		and with different conidtions (e.g. presentation of visual 
		stimulus on the Right or Left hemifield).
		User input is needed as detailed in the function matlab code.
		This script also prepares the data in a format that can be 
		used in Brainstorm software (for the step: EEG - SOURCE RECONSTRUCTION).
		EEG raw data is required in this step.
		
		> If the the user wants to use this script with their own data,  
		take attention to the fact that the first call inside this function 
		('readdata') is highly dependent on the type of data used 
		in this analysis (e.g. format 'block_*.TRC', micromed EEG system,   
		names of the electrodes saved on .TRC file, log file created  
		during the EEG stimulus presentation) and the triggers values
		used during the EEG paradigm (for further information, the user 		
		is forward to the scientific paper associated with these scripts). 	
		
		
	•  EEG - SOURCE RECONSTRUCTION
		Source reconstruction analysis with Brainstorm software. 
		By using MRI data aquired on the same subjects, it performs
		source reconstruction on the signals obtained in the previous step.
		It also extracts the current source density values inside a given 
		region of interest within the brain and prepares the data in 
		a format that can be used in matlab easily (for the step: EEG - IHTT )
		User input is needed as detailed in the function matlab code.
		Freesurfer output files are needed in this step.
		
		> To replicate the results of the associated scientific article,
		the region of interest is the region containing the primary 
		and secondary visual cortices - V1V2 - on the left or right
		brain hemispheres (set by default). 
	
		
	•  EEG - CLUSTER PERMUTATION 
		Performs cluster permutation statistics on the current source 
		density values obtained in the source reconstruction (step: EEG - 
		SOURCE RECONSTRUCTION), within a given region of interest.
		
		> To replicate the results of the associated scientific article,
		the region of interest is the region containing the primary 
		and secondary visual cortices - V1V2 - on the left or right
		brain hemispheres (set by default).
		
	•  EEG - IHTT ESTIMATION 
		Estimates the IHTT, in ms, from the group average current source 
		density, obtained in the previous step (EEG - SOURCE RECONSTRUCTION).
		Using sub-groups of the available subjects, calculates a
		standard deviation, in ms, around the estimated IHTT. This 
		will be used to define a confidence interval on the IHTT estimation 
		that will be used on the next step (BIOPHYSICAL MODEL OF MICROSTRUCTURE)
		to provide a confidence interval on the microstructural estimates obtained.
		
		> To replicate the results of the associated scientific article,
		given that the IHTT concerned only the 'Left' visual stimulation, 
		cond_list is {'Left'} (set by default).
		
	•  BIOPHYSICAL MODEL OF MICROSTRUCTURE
		Estimates microstructural features of the white matter:
		the axon radius distribution, P(r), and the g-ratio dependence on
		the radius, g(r).
		MRI g-ratio estimates sampled along a white matter tract and the
		corresponding tract length are needed in this step, along with the 
		IHTT estimated in step EEG - IHTT ESTIMATION.
		
		> To replicate the results of the associated scientific article,
		the tract to be used is the visual transcallosal tract, connecting 
		the primary and secondary visual areas (V1V2) from both hemispheres 
		and the delay is the IHTT (using a left visual field stimulation).
		The script assumes as default that the 'G_ratio_samples.mat' and 
		'length.mat' were obtained on this tract and loads the IHTT 
		estimated in the previous step (EEG - IHTT ESTIMATION).

HOW TO USE:

Important: the analysis scripts need to be run from the 'main' scripts folder.

The first step is to set your local data paths by editing and running the script:
    Set_paths()

Then edit and run the following script to define the parameters for your analysis:
    Set_params()

The EEG analysis consists of several parts that can be run independently 
as long as the previous step was performed:
    EEG_Step1_Preprocessing()        - requires manual input to clean the EEG data
    EEG_Step2_SourceReconstruction() - requires outputs from EEG_Step1_Preprocessing as well manual input on Brainstorm
    EEG_Step3_ClusterPermutation()   - requires output files from EEG_Step2_SourceReconstruction
    EEG_Step4_IHTT()                 - requires output files from EEG_Step2_SourceReconstruction

The biophysical model of microstructure can finally be run with:
    MODEL()                          - requires output files from EEG_Step4_IHTT 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: the data used in the original publication is publicly available.	
The analysis steps EEG - IHTT ESTIMATION and 
BIOPHYSICAL MODEL OF MICROSTRUCTURE can be run on the provided data.
